## How I Built This Portfolio

### HTML Structure

The project's HTML structure is designed with a clean and organized layout. It includes sections for an about page, work/projects, and contact information. Navigation links are provided for easy access to each section.

### CSS Styling

CSS is used to style the portfolio, providing an attractive and professional appearance. Key styling elements include:

- **Navbar**: A responsive navbar with a fixed position and smooth scrolling functionality. It features a logo and navigation links that change appearance on hover.

- **About Section**: A visually appealing about section with a gradient background, welcoming message, and a brief introduction.

- **Work Section**: A projects section showcasing Chosen's work, with responsive project tiles and a "Show All" button for navigation.

- **Contact Section**: A contact section with social media links and contact details, encouraging collaboration and communication.

- **Footer**: A responsive footer with copyright information and a distinctive color scheme.

## Lessons Learned

Building this portfolio has provided valuable experience and learning opportunities, including:

- HTML and CSS proficiency, especially in creating responsive layouts.
- Effective use of external libraries like Font Awesome and Google Fonts.
- Enhanced understanding of creating navigation menus and smooth scrolling effects.

## Future Improvements

In the future, I plan to expand this portfolio by adding more projects and further enhancing its interactivity. Possible improvements include integrating a backend for a contact form and continuously updating the project list as skills and experience grow.
